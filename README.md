This is a Library for 1-Wire DA18B20 Temperature Sensor setup on Nuvoton Mini58 (ARM Cortex-M0) MCU.
this code will work when you setup only one DS18B20 Sensor on your 1-Wire bus.


# In this repository
In this repository, you will got
1. one Main code named "main.c"
2. one c library code file named "DS18B20LibraryforMini58.c"
3. one Header file for c library named "DS18B20LibraryforMini58.h"


# Setup

1. Put these three things into your project
2. If it's possible, get a USB to TTL module for UART debugging
3. UART0 was chooesn as default,P12 for RX0,P13 for TX0,set your wire and Serial terminal(1) up

   (Baudrate:115200, Data Bits:8, Parity:None, Stop Bits:1, Floe Control:None)
4. Set DS18B20 VCC,DATA and GND wire up, follow the DATASHEET(2),DATA PIN was P25 on MCU as default

5. Download your project code to MCU and Run then look at terminal window

# Outcome
You will GET REAL Temperature in Celsius Degree about EVERY 0.3 sce
